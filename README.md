This Repository is to serve as nothing more than a guide to study and refer to, with each file being my personal approach to the questions at hand

If you are to use the Library Index type 2 file, make sure you
 1 - Have Openpyxl downloaded and functioning
 2 - Have moved the Library_Users.xlsx file into the proper location
    - Whereever you point the directory to
 3 - Change the file directory within the script
   - File directory is saved as variable "path" located near the top of the script
