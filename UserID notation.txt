UserID generator Documentation

Target Audience: Administrators and General Users
Scope: User ID generation
Series: IS documentation

Scope: 
User IDS are generated randomly using the user's first and last name, taking their first initial, the second 
letter of thier name, the last two letters of their last name, a randomly generated 4 digit number, and two randomly chosen special 
characters

Using the pre-existing python module, random, two special characters are chosen from a list containing commonly
used special characters, which are capped onto each end of the User ID. The same module is used to choose a 4 
digit number from which different values are extracted from mathematically

A check for Duplicate IDs is included in order to prevent two people from having conflicting login information
which can lead to system conflicts, errors, and breaches

User ID Format:
[sp1][fin1][fin2][num1][lin1][lin2][num2][sp2]

Details of User ID format:
sp1/2 -> A special character (ie ", #, ?, !)
fin1/2 -> The first initial and the second letter of the user's first name
lin1/2 -> The last and second to last character of the user's last name
num1 -> The tens place of the randomly generated number
num2 - > The whole randomly generated 4 digit number

Case - Sensitivity:
User ID is not Case sensitive due to conversions that take place within the code
Although it can be proven useful in the event that your information is leaked by increasing the number of 
possible case possiblities when trying to brute force a password

Error Handling:
.strip is used for any unexpected whitespaces that may appear within the user's responses
A check for Duplicate IDs is included in order to prevent two people from having conflicting login information

Conclusion:
A simple UserID generator such as the one provided can help mitigate the possiblity of system breaches and helps
users with practicing safe internet usage, while giving an example of a secure userID and/or password, in the
event that the generator is used for a passowrd generator, use a different ID from the one created for the 
UserID
